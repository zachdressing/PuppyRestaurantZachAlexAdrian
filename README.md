Puppy Restaurant: Created a responsive replication of the prototype provided. (aliteration is fun).<br>
Peer Review by (Reivewers Name): Ellie Rasuli

Very good looking website! The scrolling thing on the about and catering page is REALLY cool I like that a lot

On Catering, your hamburger dropdown menu isn't working? Maybe check that out and see
On the About page, responsiveness works, it just looks a little awkward on Laptop (1440px) size because it goes two cards and then one card instead of being evenly displayed
On phone screen sizes, Catering has no images at all (not sure if intentional) and on the about page, the team cards are not centered and are instead off to the side
On the prototype, the links are moved slightly inwards, while on your website only the logo is. It will look more centered if the links are also moved in towards the center

Good job! Just some tiny things to fix
